# Usage Guide

This wrapper will allow sending sms and creating data to zender using pure GET requests.

> This will work for /send and /create POST endpoints

To use the wrapper simply replace "/api/" to "/getwrap/" on your request url, this guide assumes that you already uploaded this wrapper on your zender site.

It is recommended to only use this wrapper for personal or internal use only and not for you user consumption.
